Prerequisites
-------------

All plots are generated using Python scripts (.py files).
These scripts use well-known packages, as included in all Scientific Python Distributions,
e.g. in Anaconda ( https://www.anaconda.com/download ).

Apart from that, they make use of a few functions written by one of the authors.
These are all gathered into a publically available GitHub repository named 'cmutils':
https://github.com/sintharic/cmutils.

In order to execute the .py files in this folder, the directory containing the cmutils
repository must be part of your Python path (as explained in the README.md of the repository).
